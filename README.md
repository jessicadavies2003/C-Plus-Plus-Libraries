# C++ Libraries for your Convenience!
I've complied a handful of C++ classes for many issues you may face in your coding journey! Including:

- Better strings
- Dictionaries (inspired by Python)
- Queues

...and many more!

# Is any credit required?
It's not mandatory, but I would be grateful if you did!
